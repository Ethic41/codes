NOTHING IN COMMON
Alice has quarreled with Berta recently. Now she doesn't want to have anything in common with her!

Recently, they've received two collections of positive integers. The Alice's integers were A1, A2, ..., AN, while Berta's were
B1, B2, ..., BM.

Now Alice wants to throw away the minimal amount of number from her collection so that their collections would have no common 
numbers, i.e. there won't be any number which is present in both collections. Please help Alice to find the minimal amount of 
numbers she would need to throw away.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integer numbers N and M denoting the amount of numbers in Alice's
and Berta's collections respectively.

The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the numbers of Alice.

The third line contains M space-separated integers B1, B2, ..., BM denoting the numbers of Berta.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the minimal amount of numbers Alice needs to throw away from her collection 
so that she wouldn't have any numbers in common with Berta.

Constraints

1 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 106
All numbers are distinct within a single girl's collection.

Explanation

Example case 1. If Alice throws away the number 3 from her collection, she would obtain {1, 2} which is disjoint with 
{3, 4, 5, 6}.

Example case 2. Girls don't have any number in common initially. So there is no need to throw away any number.

CATS AND DOGS

Chef is a farmer and a pet lover. He has a lot of his favorite pets cats and dogs in the barn. He does not know their exact 
count. But he knows that there are C cats and D dogs in the barn. Also, one day went to field and found that there were L legs 
of the animals touching the ground. Chef knows that cats love to ride on the dogs. So, they might ride on the dogs, and 
their legs won't touch the ground and Chef would miss counting their legs. Chef's dogs are strong enough to ride at max two 
cats on their back.

It was a cold foggy morning, when Chef did this counting. So he is now wondering whether he counted the legs properly or not. 
Specifically, he is wondering is there a some possibility of his counting being correct. Please help Chef in finding it.

Input

First line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases. T test cases follow.

The only line of each test case contains three space separated integers C, D, L denoting number of the cats, number of the 
dogs and number of legs of animals counted by Chef, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing a string "yes" or "no" (both without quotes) according to the situation.

Explanation

Example 1. There is one cat and one dog. The number of legs of these animals on the ground are 8, it can be possible when 
both cat and dog are standing on the ground.

Example 2. There is one cat and one dog. The number of legs of these animals on the ground are 4, it can be possible if the 
cat will ride on the dog, so its legs won't be counted by Chef, only the dog's legs will be counted.

Example 3. There is one cat and one dog. The number of legs of these animals are 2, it can not be true at all, Chef might 
have made some mistake. Hence answer is "no".


CHEF AND THE WAY

After visiting a childhood friend, Chef wants to get back to his home. Friend lives at the first street, and Chef himself 
lives at the N-th (and the last) street.
Their city is a bit special: you can move from the X-th street to the Y-th street if and only if 1 <= Y - X <= K, where K 
is the integer value that is given to 
you. Chef wants to get to home in such a way that the product of all the visited streets' special numbers is minimal 
(including the first and the N-th street).
Please, help him to find such a product.

Input

The first line of input consists of two integer numbers - N and K - the number of streets and the value of K respectively. 
The second line consist of N numbers
- A1, A2, ..., AN respectively, where Ai equals to the special number of the i-th street.

Output

Please output the value of the minimal possible product, modulo 1000000007.

ENTRANCE EXAM

The faculty of application management and consulting services (FAMCS) of the Berland State University (BSU) has always been 
popular among Berland's enrollees. 
This year, N students attended the entrance exams, but no more than K will enter the university. In order to decide who are 
these students, 
there are series of entrance exams. All the students with score strictly greater than at least (N-K) students' total score 
gets enrolled.

In total there are E entrance exams, in each of them one can score between 0 and M points, inclusively. The first E-1 exams had already been conducted, 
and now it's time for the last tribulation.

Sergey is the student who wants very hard to enter the university, so he had collected the information about the first E-1 
from all N-1 enrollees 
(i.e., everyone except him). Of course, he knows his own scores as well.

In order to estimate his chances to enter the University after the last exam, Sergey went to a fortune teller. From the visit, 
he learnt about scores that everyone except him will get at the last exam. Now he wants to calculate the minimum score he needs 
to score in order to enter 
to the university. But now he's still very busy with minimizing the amount of change he gets in the shops, so he asks you to 
help him.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains four space separated integers N, K, E, M denoting the number of students, 
the maximal number of students who'll get 
enrolled, the total number of entrance exams and maximal number of points for a single exam, respectively.

The following N-1 lines will contain E integers each, where the first E-1 integers correspond to the scores of the exams 
conducted. 
The last integer corresponds to the score at the last exam, that was predicted by the fortune-teller.

The last line contains E-1 integers denoting Sergey's score for the first E-1 exams.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum score Sergey should get in the last exam in order to 
be enrolled. 
If Sergey doesn't have a chance to be enrolled, output "Impossible" (without quotes).

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ K < N ≤ 104
1 ≤ M ≤ 109
1 ≤ E ≤ 4
Example

Input:
1
4 2 3 10
7 7 7
4 6 10
7 10 9
9 9

Output:
4
Explanation

Example case 1. If Sergey gets 4 points at the last exam, his score will be equal to 9+9+4=22. This will be the second 
score among all the enrollees - 
the first one will get 21, the second one will get 20 and the third will have the total of 26. Thus, Sergey will enter 
the university.



COLLISIONS

Once N boys and M girls attended a party. You are given a matrix A of N rows and M columns where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy 
likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0. Note that it is not necessary that if a boy x likes girl y, then girl y should 
like boy x.

You know that if there are two different boys x and y, who both like girl z, then there will be a collision. 
Can you calculate the number of different collisions at this party? Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter.

Input

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M denoting the number of boys and girls, 
respectively.

Each of the following N lines contain M characters, each of them is either '0' or '1'.

Output

For each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of collisions at the party.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10
Example

Input:
2
4 3
111
100
110

Output:
4
0
Explanation

Example Case 1. All three boys like the first girl, so there are (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 1) collisions with her. 
Boys 1 and 3 both like the second girl so this is one more collision. Only one boy likes the third girl, so there are no 
collisions with her and thus we have 4 collisions total.

Example Case 2. For each girl there is only one boy who likes her, so there are no collisions at all.

DRUMPF FOR PRESIDENT


Donald Drumpf has spent the entire summer lobbying to gather votes for the upcoming student government election. 
At his University, there are a total of N 
students. Each student in the university casts a vote. The size of student government is determined by the number of 
students that get at least K votes.

Each person that receives at least K votes is given a post in the student government. The Dean noticed that every year, 
there are a few students who vote for 
themselves. He decided to add a rule to disqualify any such individuals who vote for themselves i.e they cannot be part of 
the student government.

You are given an array A, where Ai denotes the person who the i-th person voted for. Can you compute the size of the student 
government?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

For each test case, first line consists of two space separated integers N, K.

Second line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A, where i-th integer denotes Ai.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the size of the student government.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ K ≤ N
1 ≤ Ai ≤ N
Subtasks

1 ≤ N ≤ 100
Example

Input:
2
3 2
2 1 2
2 1
1 2

Output:
1
0
Explanation

In first test case, there are 3 students. A student must receive at least 2 votes to be part of the student government. 
Student 1 votes for student 2, 
student 2 votes for student 1 and student 3 votes for student 2. Thus, Student 2 receives 2 votes and is the only one 
eligible for student government.

In second test case, although both students receive the required amount of votes, they are both disqualified as they had 
voted for themselves. 
Thus, size of the student government is 0.

MAKE XOR ZERO

Olya has written N binary integers (i.e. either zero or one) on a blackboard. She recently learned about XOR operation. 
Now she wants to erase exactly one
integer in the array so that the XOR of the remaining N - 1 numbers is zero. Please help her to calculate the number of 
ways of doing so.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of numbers that Olya has written on a

Example case 1. If you erase the first number on the blackboard, then the XOR of the rest of numbers will be equal to zero.

Example case 2. You can erase any of the given 5 numbers, it will make the XOR of the rest equal to zero.


WHO DARES TO BE A MILLIONAIRE

Chef is going to participate in a new quiz show: "Who dares to be a millionaire?"

According to the rules of the game, contestants must answer N questions. The quiz being famous for its difficulty, 
each question has 26 candidate answers, but only one of which is correct. Answers are denoted by capital Latin letters 
from A to Z. Chef knows all the questions that can be asked, and for each of them he knows the answer candidate he 
will choose (some of them can be incorrect). For each question, we'll tell you Chef's answer to it.

The game goes on as follows. FIRST, ALL THE QUESTIONS ARE SHUFFLED RANDOMLY. THEN, A CONTESTANT IS ASKED THESE 
QUESTIONS ONE-BY-ONE IN THE NEW SHUFFLED ORDER. IF THE CONTESTANT ANSWERS ANY QUESTION INCORRECTLY, THE GAME IS OVER. 
Total winnings of the contestant are calculated as follows. Let X denote the number of questions answered correctly by 
the contestant. Depending on this value, the winnings are determined: W0 dollars is the amount won for X = 0, W1 dollars is 
for X = 1, and so on till X = N. Note that the game was invented by a twisted mind, and so a case where Wi ≥ Wi + 1 for 
some 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1 is possible.
Chef is interested in finding the maximum possible winnings that he can amass.

Input

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of questions.

Next line contains N capital Latin letters denoting the correct answers to these questions.

Next line contains N capital Latin letters denoting answers given by Chef to these questions.

Next line contains N + 1 space-separated integers W0, W1, ..., WN denoting the winnings for 0, 1, ..., N correct answers.

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing the value of maximum possible winnings that Chef can get.

and it is correct as well), 4th (Chef's answer is D, and he is right), 5th (Chef's answer is A but correct answer is E and 
the game is over), 1st, Chef will correctly answer 3 questions, and therefore win 30 dollars.

Example case 2. Chef's answers for all questions are incorrect, so his winnings are W0 dollars.

Example case 3. Since all Wi are equal to 100 dollars, Chef will win this sum in any possible case.

GOOD JOKE


Vadim and Roman like discussing challenging problems with each other. One day Vadim told his friend following problem:

Given N points on a plane. Each point p is defined by it's two integer coordinates — px and py. The distance between 
points a and b is min(|ax - bx|, |ay - by|). You should choose a starting point and make a route visiting every point 
exactly once, i.e. if we write down numbers of points in order you visit them we should obtain a permutation. Of course, 
overall distance walked should be as small as possible. The number of points may be up to 40.

"40? Maybe 20? Are you kidding?" – asked Roman. "No, it's not a joke" – replied Vadim. So Roman had nothing to do, 
but try to solve this problem. Since Roman is really weak in problem solving and you are the only friend, except Vadim, 
with whom Roman can discuss challenging tasks, he has nobody else to ask for help, but you!
Input

Input description.

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of points on a plane. The following N lines 
contain two space-separated integers each — coordinates of points.
Output

Output description.

Output the answer for every test case in a separate line. The answer for every test case is a permutation of length N. 
In case there are several solutions that lead to minimal distance walked, you should choose the lexicographically smallest one. 
Let P denote such permutation. To make output smaller, you should output H(P). H(P) = P1 xor P2 xor ... xor PN. 
Have a look at the example and it's explanation for better understanding.
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 40
0 ≤ absolute value of each coordinate ≤ 1000
1 ≤ sum over all N in a single test file ≤ 120
Example

Input:
2
2
1 2
0 0
3
3 3
0 0
0 3
Output:
3
0
Explanation

For the first test case permutation [1, 2] is optimal. 1 xor 2 = 3. 
For the second one both [2, 3, 1] and [1, 3, 2] lead us to the shortest walk, but the second one is lexicographically smaller. 
So the answer is H([1, 3, 2]) = 1 xor 3 xor 2 = 0 .



Team Formation For Snackdown


There are n people who want to take part in SnackDown. In the competition in this problem, a team should consist of exactly 
two people (as opposed to the real contest, where single-member teams are allowed). Of course, a person can only participate 
in a single team. Out of these, 2 * m people have already formed their teams, i.e. there are m teams already formed. 
The remaining people want to participate and make teams amongst themselves. Can you please tell whether it is possible 
to divide them into teams so that all the n people can participate?

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers n, m.

The i-th of the next m lines contains two space separated integers ui, vi denoting that the pair of people ui, 
and vi have decided to form a team.

Output
For each test case, output "yes" or "no" (without quotes) corresponding to the answer of the problem.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
2 ≤ n ≤ 100
1 ≤ m ≤ n / 2
1 ≤ ui, vi ≤ n
The m already formed teams will be valid.

Explanation
Example 1. Persons 1 and 2 have already formed the team. No other person is left. So, the answer is yes.

Example 2. Persons 1 and 3 have already formed the team. Persons 2 and 4 can form their own team. No other person is left. 
So, the answer is yes.

Example 3. Persons 1 and 2 have already formed the team. Persons 4 and 5 have also formed their own team. 
Only person 3 is left. A single person can't form a team. So, the answer is no.

Example 4. Persons 1 and 4 have already formed the team. Persons 2, 3 and 5 cannot all participate, because at 
least one person will be left out. So, the answer is no.


Chef and his daily routine

Chef's daily routine is very simple. He starts his day with cooking food, then he eats the food and finally proceeds for 
sleeping thus ending his day. Chef carries a robot as his personal assistant whose job is to log the activities of Chef at 
various instants during the day. Today it recorded activities that Chef was doing at N different instants. These instances 
are recorded in chronological order (in increasing order of time). This log is provided to you in form of a string s of 
length N, consisting of characters 'C', 'E' and 'S'. If s[i] = 'C', then it means that at the i-th instant Chef was cooking, 
'E' denoting he was eating and 'S' means he was sleeping.

You have to tell whether the record log made by the robot could possibly be correct or not.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains string s.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing "yes" or "no" (without quotes) accordingly.

Explanation
Example case 1. "CES" can correspond to a possible record of activities of Chef. He starts the day with cooking, 
then eating and then sleeping.

Example case 2. "CS" can also correspond to a possible record of activities of Chef. He starts the day with cooking, 
then eating and then sleeping. Robot recorded his cooking and sleeping in order. He might not have recorded his eating activity.

Example case 4. "SC" can not correspond to Chef's activities. Here it means that Chef slept first, then he cooked the food, 
which is impossible for Chef to do on some particular day.


Snake Procession


The annual snake festival is upon us, and all the snakes of the kingdom have gathered to participate in the procession. 
Chef has been tasked with reporting on the procession, and for this he decides to first keep track of all the snakes. 
When he sees a snake first, it'll be its Head, and hence he will mark a 'H'. The snakes are long, and when he sees the 
snake finally slither away, he'll mark a 'T' to denote its tail. In the time in between, when the snake is moving past him, 
or the time between one snake and the next snake, he marks with '.'s.

Because the snakes come in a procession, and one by one, a valid report would be something like "..H..T...HTH....T.", 
or "...", or "HT", whereas "T...H..H.T", "H..T..H", "H..H..T..T" would be invalid reports (See explanations at the bottom).

Formally, a snake is represented by a 'H' followed by some (possibly zero) '.'s, and then a 'T'. A valid report is one 
such that it begins with a (possibly zero length) string of '.'s, and then some (possibly zero) snakes between which 
there can be some '.'s, and then finally ends with some (possibly zero) '.'s.

Chef had binged on the festival food and had been very drowsy. So his report might be invalid. You need to help him find 
out if his report is valid or not.

Input
The first line contains a single integer, R, which denotes the number of reports to be checked. The description of 
each report follows after this.
The first line of each report contains a single integer, L, the length of that report.
The second line of each report contains a string of length L. The string contains only the characters '.', 'H', and 'T'.
Output
For each report, output the string "Valid" or "Invalid" in a new line, depending on whether it was a valid report or not.
Constraints
1 ≤ R ≤ 500
1 ≤ length of each report ≤ 500
Example
Input:
6
18
..H..T...HTH....T.
3
...
10
H..H..T..T
2
HT
11
.T...H..H.T
7
H..T..H

Output:
Valid
Valid
Invalid
Valid
Invalid
Invalid
Explanation
"H..H..T..T" is invalid because the second snake starts before the first snake ends, which is not allowed.

".T...H..H.T" is invalid because it has a 'T' before a 'H'. A tail can come only after its head.

"H..T..H" is invalid because the last 'H' does not have a corresponding 'T'.


La Liga 


Today is the final round of La Liga, the most popular professional football league in the world. Real Madrid is playing 
against Malaga and Barcelona is 
playing against Eibar. These two matches will decide who wins the league title. Real Madrid is already 3 points ahead of 
Barcelona in the league standings. 
In fact, Real Madrid will win the league title, except for one scenario: If Real Madrid loses against Malaga, and 
Barcelona wins against Eibar, then the 
La Liga title will go to Barcelona. In any other combination of results, Real Madrid will win the title.

You will be given multiple scenarios for these two games, where in each one you will be given the number of goals each 
team scored in their respective match. 
A team wins a match if it scores more than the opponent. In case they score the same number of goals, it's a draw. 
Otherwise, the team loses the game. 
You are asked to tell the winner of the La Liga title in each scenario.

Input
The first line contains a single number T, the number of scenarios. Each scenario is described by four lines. Each line 
starts with a team name followed by 
the number of goals this team scored in its corresponding match. (Barcelona plays Eibar and Real Madrid plays Malaga). 
The names are given in any arbitrary 
order within a scenario.

Output
For each scenario, output a single line showing the title winner in case this scenario happens. It should be 
either "RealMadrid" or "Barcelona".

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 500
0 ≤ number of goals scored by a team in a match ≤ 20
Example
Input:
2
Barcelona 2
Malaga 1
RealMadrid 1
Eibar 0
Malaga 3
RealMadrid 2
Barcelona 8
Eibar 6

Output:
RealMadrid
Barcelona
Explanations
In the first scenario, Barcelona wins against Eibar, because they scored more goals (2 > 0). But Real Madrid draws 
against Malaga, because they both score 1 goal each. So, Real Madrid wins the league title.

In the second scenario, Barcelona wins against Eibar (8 > 6). And Real Madrid loses against Malaga (2 < 3). 
This satisfies the only criteria needed for Barcelona to win the title: Barcelona winning, and Real Madrid losing. 
Hence, Barcelona is the answer for this scenario.



Bear and Candies 123


Bears love candies and games involving eating them. Limak and Bob play the following game. Limak eats 1 candy, 
then Bob eats 2 candies, then Limak eats 3 candies, then Bob eats 4 candies, and so on. Once someone can't eat what he is 
supposed to eat, he loses.

Limak can eat at most A candies in total (otherwise he would become sick), while Bob can eat at most B candies in total. 
Who will win the game? Print "Limak" or "Bob" accordingly.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers A and B denoting the maximum possible number of candies Limak 
can eat and the maximum possible number of candies Bob can eat respectively.

Test case 1. We have A = 3 and B = 2. Limak eats 1 candy first, and then Bob eats 2 candies. Then Limak is supposed to 
eat 3 candies but that would mean 1 + 3 = 4 candies in total. It's impossible because he can eat at most A candies, 
so he loses. Bob wins, and so we print "Bob".

Test case 2. Now we have A = 4 and B = 2. Limak eats 1 candy first, and then Bob eats 2 candies, 
then Limak eats 3 candies (he has 1 + 3 = 4 candies in total, which is allowed because it doesn't exceed A). 
Now Bob should eat 4 candies but he can't eat even a single one (he already ate 2 candies). Bob loses and Limak is the winner.

Test case 8. We have A = 9 and B = 12. The game looks as follows:

Limak eats 1 candy.
Bob eats 2 candies.
Limak eats 3 candies (4 in total).
Bob eats 4 candies (6 in total).
Limak eats 5 candies (9 in total).
Bob eats 6 candies (12 in total).
Limak is supposed to eat 7 candies but he can't — that would exceed A. Bob wins.



Similar Dishes


Chef has just found a recipe book, where every dish consists of exactly four ingredients. He is going to choose some 
two dishes and prepare them for dinner. Of course, he likes diversity and wants to know whether the two dishes are similar.

Two dishes are called similar if at least half of their ingredients are the same. In other words, at least two of four 
ingredients of the first dish should also be present in the second dish. The order of ingredients doesn't matter.

Your task is to examine T pairs of dishes. For each pair, check if the two dishes are similar and print "similar" or 
"dissimilar" accordingly.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains four distinct strings, denoting ingredients needed for the first dish. 
Each ingredient is represented by a string of length between 2 and 10 inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters.

The second line of each test case describes the second dish in the same format.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer — "similar" if at least half of the ingredients are same, 
and "dissimilar" otherwise (without the quotes).

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 200
The length of each string will be between 2 and 10 inclusive.
Example
Input:
5
eggs sugar flour salt
sugar eggs milk flour
aa ab ac ad
ac ad ae af
cookies sugar grass lemon
lemon meat chili wood
one two three four
one two three four
gibberish jibberish lalalalala popopopopo
jibberisz gibberisz popopopopu lalalalalu

Output:
similar
similar
dissimilar
similar
dissimilar
Explanation
Test case 1. The first dish consists of ingredients: eggs, sugar, flour, salt, while the second dish consists of: 
sugar, eggs, milk, flour. Three of four ingredients are present in both dishes (eggs, sugar, flour) so the two dishes 
are similar.

Test case 2. This example shows that strings in the input don't necessarily represent real food. The answer is 
again "similar", because two ingredients are present in both dishes ("ac" and "ad").

Test case 3. The only common ingredient is lemon, so the answer is "dissimilar". Remember that at least two 

ingredients should be present in both dishes.
