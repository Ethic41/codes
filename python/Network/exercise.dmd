sockets...
what is the difference between connection-oriented and connectionless-oriented service?
  Ans:
    connection-oriented service like TCP requires a connection to be established b4 any
    communication can occur...this applies to the sockets...
    connectionless-oriented service like UDP doesn't establish any connection b4 communication
    begins..
